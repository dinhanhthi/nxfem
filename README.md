# Nitsche Extended Finite Element method (NXFEM)

- Date started to backup to bitbucket: 27/09/2017

## Model

This project starts from the Sinha's model which is given in the paper  ***An unfitted finite-element method for elliptic and parabolic interface problems*** of Sinha.

We try to work on other problems with the same form (Barrau's, Becker's, Carraro's,...). Try to combine all models into 1 folders with the common functions.
